# Using Bitbucket for weekly reporting.
------------------------------------

## Setting up Bitbucket

- Create a user in your organization in Bitbucket (it must have full access to all repositories)
- Generate a "App password" for this user (https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/app-passwords-828781300.html)
- The App password must have READ ONLY permissions

## Opsweekly configuration

- Enable the bitbucket provider and add the required config, you can use user:pass or user:app_pass (preferred)

- Add your bitbucket username in your profile (if your bitbucket username is different than that in Opsweekly)

- Enjoy
